In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises from the misuse of `retain` and `release` (or `retainCount`) within custom accessor methods.  Consider this example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject {
    NSString *myString;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;

-(void) setMyString:(NSString *)newString {
    if (myString != newString) {
        [myString release]; // ERROR 1: Incorrect release
        myString = [newString retain];
    }
}
@end
```

**The Problem:** The `release` call in `setMyString:` is incorrect if `myString` was created elsewhere and not through a `retain`.  If `myString` is already autoreleased or has a retain count > 1, this release causes premature deallocation. Another potential issue is within dealloc, consider:

```objectivec
-(void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
```

**The Problem:** While seemingly correct, if `myString` is nil (this can be the case in some situations of incomplete initialization), calling `release` on it leads to a crash. 

The `retainCount` method itself should be avoided, it is not reliable for general memory management.
